# Reinforcement-learning_rock_paper_scissors_simulator.ipynb

This project simulates a Rock-Paper-Scissors game between agents employing various strategies. It allows users to experiment with and analyze the behavior of different strategies, including Random, Tit-for-Tat, and Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based agents. The simulator is designed to provide insights into strategic decision-making and learning over repeated rounds of play.

**Agent Strategies:**
1. Random Agent: Selects moves randomly without learning.
2. Tit-for-Tat Agent: Starts with a random move and mimics the opponent's last move.
3. Reinforcement Learning Agent: Adapts its strategy over time using Q-learning.

**What is does?**
1. Has user-defined number of rounds
2. logs of moves taken by each agent in every round
3. Final game results with win/loss/draw count
4. Visualized the tracks the RL agent's learning progress with Q-value

**You can access by:**
Open the rock_paper_scissors_simulator.ipynb file in Google Colab or your local Jupyter Notebook. Run the notebook step by step:
  Define agents.  Simulate games by entering the number of rounds and then Analyze the results and move logs
